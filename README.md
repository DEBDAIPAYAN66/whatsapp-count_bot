# whatsapp-reply_bot
This is a basic  bot developed using python 3 such that u can send a particular message to a particular user for the number of times u want to send the message to that user.
Unless u install the gekodriver to ur respective path the webdriver wont work and the automation wont take place.

link: https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases to download geckodriver as per ur system requirement.
From the above link I have downloaded and hope that will hellp you out the same as the way it did for me.
